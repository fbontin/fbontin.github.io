                sustainability and learning new things. When I'm not in front of
                the computer, I hang out with friends, enjoy nature or paint
                with watercolors.

              Sustainability is a big part of my life, so I've also incorporated
              it into this website, by trying to keep the size of the website as
              small as possible. Read more about sustainability regarding this
              website in the
