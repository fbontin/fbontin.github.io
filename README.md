# fbontin.github.io

My personal website, built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Even though this website could be build entirely by just HTML and CSS, it's not as fun as using a JavaScript framework for it.

This site can be found at [bontin.dev](https://bontin.dev).

## Sustainability

One important part when building sustainable web sites is keeping the size of the page down. For this site I've taken a few steps to ensure that:

- It's built it using Svelte, which becomes very compact compared to most other JavaScript frameworks.
- The image of me made as small as possible by using [dithering](https://doodad.dev/dither-me-this/).
- The background is made using only CSS, which also keeps the size down.

### Why does it matter?

Honestly, this probably doesn't matter too much since I won't get that many visitors to my site. I see it more as a way of learning and practicing sustainable web development, which in the future could be used in other projects.

### What could be improved?

Switching from hosting on Github to another provider would lower carbon emissions slightly according to [Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com/). However, hosting via github is both very easy and free, making it less likely that I would switch.

## How to run this?

1. Run `yarn`
2. Run `yarn dev`
3. Go to `localhost:5000`
